* NaturePhp example application and tests playground (library-only)
*
* 	This is a simple application example to show some of the possibilities of NaturePhp
*
* 	Please keep in mind NaturePhp is just an autoloaded php library system - you don't really 
* 	have to use most of these examples/functionalities as they are library specific
* 
* 	This is just for the sake of exemplifying how the system works as well as some included libraries
*
* 	Note the application structure and variables is just what i regularly use
* 	you don't have to follow any of these standards - you can just use your own.
